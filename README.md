A base FPC (first person camera) kinematic player base, for reference and using as a base for your projects.

My plan is to make a all-in-one player script and scene to allow others to import it into their project with as little effort as possible. 
I also plan on making a step-by-step wiki/instruction manual on how it all works. The deadline I'm shooting for is the end of March 2018; so that would be 11:59 PM on March 31, 2018. I think I can do that. I've already got more than half done.

**NOTE**

I'm not sure if I should make this for the latest Godot build from github, or to just go with main releases. The reason I wonder over this is because about a week ago (~20 Feb, 2018) the Godot developers changed the "move_and_slide()" command to have an additional argument: an infinite_inertia bool.
I think the new argument has something to with having the character act more like a rigid body or not.
"A dynamic character controller uses a rigid body with infinite inertial tensor. Basically, it’s a rigid body that can’t rotate."

From http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/kinematic_character_2d.html

This is a WIP as of 27 Feb, 2018.

UPDATE on 27 Feb 2018:
I'm still working on this. I was taking a break for a few days because I had been working on this and another project non-stop for a few months. I'll be back on it in a day. Sorry for any wait. 

More info to come.
